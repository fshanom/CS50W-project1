# Wiki in Python
This is a Wikipedia-based application build in Python, with the framework Django.

## Motivation
This project was built for learning purposes, by demand of the course CS50W from HarvardX. In this course, I've learned the basics of Web Development using Python's Django framework and Javascript.

## Tech/framework used
Built with:
* Python: version 3.8.5
* Django: version 3.1.3
* HTML
* CSS: Bootstrap framework

## Installation
This project uses Python and Django. Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

You will also need the markdown2 module. You can install it with this command.

```
pip3 install markdown2
```

## How to use?
After cloning the repository on your local machine, and with the resources properly installed, just run the server in the repository directory with:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

## Pages
On the application, you have 3 main pages:
* Home - shows all the entries on the application.
